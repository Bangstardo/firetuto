This is an advanced dropdown menu using react library 
Learned a more about react and how important it is to 
master CSS, so far I think react is a great tool.

Ended up spending horrendous amounts of time 
on side quests about how react runs its files 
how index.html works and app.js went all in lol. 

so far this will be the first commit.

as always thanks Jeff Delaney for being my sensei 
even if he doesn't know it.
